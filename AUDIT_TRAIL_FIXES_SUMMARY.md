# Audit Trail Fixes Documentation

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Successful Logins Not Being Logged**

**Problem**: Successful logins were only logged when MFA was not required. When MFA was required, the function returned early without logging the successful authentication.

**Solution**:

-   Added `LOGIN_SUCCESS` logging after successful MFA completion
-   Ensured complete login processes are properly logged regardless of MFA requirements

**Code Changes**:

```php
// After MFA verification in MFAController.php
AuditTrailService::logLogin($request->empno, true, 'User logged in successfully after MFA verification');
```

### 2. **MFA Disable Logging as DELETE Instead of MFA_DISABLE**

**Problem**: The `UserMFA` model has the `AuditTrailTrait` which automatically logs UPDATE/DELETE operations. When calling `$userMFA->update()` to disable MFA, it was creating a generic UPDATE audit entry instead of the specific MFA_DISABLE action.

**Solution**:

-   Used `UserMFA::withoutAuditTrail()` to temporarily disable automatic audit logging
-   Added explicit `MFA_DISABLE` logging after the operation
-   Updated `AuditTrailTrait` to check for disabled state before logging

**Code Changes**:

```php
// MFAController.php - Disable MFA without automatic audit logging
UserMFA::withoutAuditTrail(function() use ($userMFA) {
    $userMFA->update([
        'enabled_mfa' => 0,
        'mfa_remember_hash' => null,
        'mfa_remember_expires' => null
    ]);
});

// Explicit MFA disable logging
AuditTrailService::logMFADisable($request->empno, 'MFA disabled by user');
```

### 3. **Failed Login Attempts Not Being Logged**

**Problem**: The `validateUser()` method was returning JSON error responses directly without logging failed login attempts.

**Solution**: Added audit logging for all failure scenarios:

-   User not found
-   Incorrect password
-   Password decryption errors
-   Password reset required
-   Account status issues

**Code Changes**:

```php
// AuthenticationController.php - Various failure scenarios
if (!$user) {
    AuditTrailService::logLogin($request->username, false, 'Login failed - user not found');
    return response()->json(['error' => 'Incorrect Username or Password.'], 200);
}

if (!Hash::check($decryptedPassword, $user->password)) {
    AuditTrailService::logLogin($request->username, false, 'Login failed - incorrect password');
    return response()->json(['error' => 'Incorrect Username or Password'], 200);
}
```

### 4. **Additional MFA-Related Logging Issues**

**Problem**: MFA setup, verification, and other operations were not consistently logged or were creating duplicate entries.

**Solution**:

-   Disabled automatic audit trail logging for all MFA model operations
-   Added explicit logging for each MFA action type
-   Ensured failed operations are logged with appropriate action types

## New Action Types Added

## Enhanced Action Coverage

All these actions now have comprehensive logging:

-   `LOGIN_SUCCESS` - Complete successful login
-   `LOGIN_FAILED` - Any login failure scenario
-   `LOGOUT` - User logout
-   `MFA_SETUP` - MFA setup completion
-   `MFA_VERIFY` - Successful MFA verification
-   `MFA_VERIFY_FAILED` - Failed MFA verification
-   `MFA_DISABLE` - MFA disabled by user
-   `MFA_DISABLE_FAILED` - Failed MFA disable attempt
-   `MFA_RESET` - Admin MFA reset

## Frontend Updates

Updated action options and severity mappings:

```javascript
const actionOptions = ref([
    { label: "Login Success", value: "LOGIN_SUCCESS" },
    { label: "Login Failed", value: "LOGIN_FAILED" },
    // ... other actions
]);

const getActionSeverity = (action) => {
    const severityMap = {
        LOGIN_SUCCESS: "success",
        LOGIN_FAILED: "danger",
        // ... other mappings
    };
    return severityMap[action] || "secondary";
};
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`AuditTrailFixesTest.php`) covering:

-   Successful login logging (with and without MFA)
-   Failed login attempt logging (various scenarios)
-   MFA disable proper action logging
-   MFA verification success/failure logging
-   Account status and password reset requirement logging

## Key Improvements

1. **Complete Audit Coverage**: Every authentication and MFA operation is now properly logged
2. **Specific Action Types**: No more generic UPDATE/DELETE entries for MFA operations
3. **Failure Tracking**: All failure scenarios are logged with descriptive messages
4. **Consistent Logging**: Uniform approach across all controllers
5. **No Duplicate Entries**: Eliminated automatic model audit entries where explicit logging is used

## Validation Steps

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Test Login Success**: Log in successfully and verify `LOGIN_SUCCESS` entries
2. **Test Login Failures**: Try wrong passwords, non-existent users, etc. - verify `LOGIN_FAILED` entries
3. **Test MFA Disable**: Disable MFA and verify `MFA_DISABLE` action (not UPDATE or DELETE)
4. **Test MFA Verification**: Verify MFA codes and check for appropriate success/failure logging
5. **Test Logout**: Log out and verify `LOGOUT` entry
6. **Filter Testing**: Use frontend filters to ensure all action types can be filtered properly

All audit trail entries should now have:

-   Correct action types matching frontend filters
-   Descriptive messages explaining the operation
-   Proper module categorization
-   Complete coverage of success and failure scenarios
